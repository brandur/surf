So when I think of surfing, I generally have this idea in my mind of guys in boardshorts and bare chests out on the water shredding waves. As it turns out, this idea is pretty far off because in reality no surfer leaves the shore without their rash guard (or a wetsuit in colder climates).

For the uninitiated, a rash guard (or "rashie" if you're speaking to the Ozzies) is an athletic shirt made out of spandex and nylon or polyester used in a variety of watersports including surfing, scuba diving, wakeboarding, and kayaking, among others. Surf boards are waxed to give surfers enough friction to stay upright on the board, and without a rash guard, this wax will start to rub against a surfer's chest while he's paddling and start to leave the beginnings of what might turn out to be a brutal rash. Even worse, the board's wax can retain sand and further accelerate the process.

So here's me out in the waves for three or four hours yesterday with no rash and wondering what all the fuss is about. I wake up early this morning and head out there, and realize pretty quickly that the pain involved in surfing has just jumped tenfold thanks to the brand new angry red rash on my chest. It's okay though, because at this point I've just accepted that I learn all my lessons the hard way.

Luckily I'd given into learned advice last night and bought my very own rashie. I'm really looking forward to it preventing any repeats of this morning.

I'm typing this out on a bus midway between first destination Tamarindo, and our next destination Guiones.
