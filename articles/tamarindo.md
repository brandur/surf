Despite being almost the last person off the plane, I successfully met up with my guide Will upon landing in Liberia. Three other really chill people from the tour also turned out to be on the same flight, and the worst part is that we all saw each other during the five hour layover in Houston and wondered whether we might be part of the same tour. Morale of the story next time meet up on Facebook and agree to all wear red scarves to pick each other out and have a drink before connecting to Costa Rica.

We had some beers on the 1.5 hour ride into Tamarindo from Liberia, dropped our stuff off at the hotel, and got a quick tour of the town. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and its gate is guarded all night by a watchman and his canine sidekick. It was 11 o'clock by the time we got in so we grabbed a taco at the only place in town still open, and got a quick tour of the area (this is practical because the town's central area is only a few blocks long).

We met up with a few other cool people from the tour, and proceeded to grab some drinks at the local convenience store before heading out to one of the local clubs for Reggae night. After a few hours of dancing we headed out to the beach for a 4:00 AM swim in the darkness. One of our guys stayed behind to watch our stuff because apparently anything left on the beach will almost certainly be stolen.

We arrived back at the compound had some nice discussion to wind down the night. After my roommates head off to try and get some sleep, I hurriedly put together this blog post (it's about 6:00 AM here). Even as i watch, a feral cat tries to enter our room through the open door, and the canine guard howls and scares it off.

Crap, the sun is rising. Our first surfing lesson starts at 2 PM tomorrow (or today rather). It's going to be a good trip.
