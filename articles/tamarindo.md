Despite being almost the last person off the plane, I successfully met up with my guide Will upon landing in Liberia. Three other really chill people from the tour also turned out to be on the same flight, and the worst part is that we all saw each other during the five hour layover in Houston and wondered whether we might be part of the same tour. Morale of the story next time meet up on Facebook and agree to all wear red scarves to pick each other out and have a drink before connecting to Costa Rica.
