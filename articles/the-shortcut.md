So we were able to pile eleven people and one surfboard into a small van to get us to Guiones, a feat that we were afraid wasn't going to be physically possible. The only problem left was that the van's motor really wasn't in any shape to deliver the kind of power we needed to tackle some of the obstacles found on the Costa Rican motorways: steep hills that they run up, and deep rivers that they run through.

The standard trip from Tamarindo to Guiones is about four hours. To spend less time in a cramped van, our guide elected to take a slightly riskier road that more than halves the trip's time down to less than two hours. This shortcut is mostly for those who don't mind putting the condition of their vehicle in a bit of danger&mdash;on one of the previous trips a guide drove a rental through a stream and waterlogged the engine costing the agency a cool $8k in damages.

All in all the little van held out pretty well with the exception of a few tiny hitches. The first was when we were coasting along a flat section of road and the engine stalled out and wouldn't restart no matter how many times the driver tried the ignition. After we lost most of our speed, Will hopped out and pushed the car along a fair way. Finally, the engine started.

Elsewhere, we came around a bend to find a pretty significant river running across the road. Knowing that in situations like this losing momentum can be dangerous, our driver promptly floored it and dove us right in. We made it all the way to the other side before the van couldn't get enough traction to get out of the river. We bravely offered to jump ship so that the van had some chance of being salvaged. After a few more tense moments and a giant cloud of black smoke, the van pulled free.

Despite these small setbacks, we made it to the beautiful town of Guiones. And now I'm going surfing.
