The Surf is the two week chronicle of one man's trip to Costa Rica to do what most landlocked Canadians can only dream of: learn to ride the waves of the Pacific Ocean. Having never stepped foot on a board, it's a personal challenge to see the kind of skill that can emerge given only determination, and two weeks of focus and hard work.

Provided that I can find a working Internet connection, I'll write about subjects like my experience building a skill from the scratch, whether skill in skiing carries over to surfing, Costa Rican natural history, and my observations on the lifestyles of more skillful surfers and instructors.

Provided **no** working Internet connection, I'll write down in posts in my hipster moleskine and make them available upon my return.

Locale
------

The trip, starting January 20th, will take place across three Costa Rican destinations:

* **The village of Tamarindo (A)** along the northwest coastline of Costa Rica.

* **Playa Guiones (B)**, a jungle haven along the longest beach in Costa Rica, reached my travelling south down the coast. The area is famous for both surfing, and being one of the most pristine and ecologically well-maintained beaches in the world.

* **The tip of the Nicoya Peninsula (C)**, known for being a wave rich surfing destination, with close access to many beaches.

We start out learning basic skills in Tamarindo, then move onto some real surfing at Playa Guiones. After moving onto some more sizable challenges at an unnamed location at the tip of Nicoya Peninsula, we'll return to Tamarindo and try some more advanced areas there.

Flights arrive and depart from the Daniel Oduber International Airport in Liberia, a city of about 35,000 inhabitants just northeast of Tamarindo.

Philosophy
----------

Even for those of us who are passionate about our careers and what we do, it's important to take a break once in a while and give ourselves the chance to try something completely different. Getting away from the tireless brouhaha of the business world is important for the cultivation of new ideas, gaining some perspective on your life, and of course&mdash;basic relaxation.

Being in IT, I also think that an important aspect of vacation is to leave behind the computer, and the interconnectedness it provides. In today's world, the computer is the most valuable tool that we can possibly have, but at the same time it's an endless source of distraction, and the inherent busyness it brings to the mind stems the incubation of new original thoughts and ideas. I'd highly recommend reading [conceding defeat &mdash; the Internet is stronger than I am](http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/conceding-defeat-the-internet-is-stronger-than-i-am) by Sebastian Marshall.

Fostering creativity is one of the most noble pursuits available to any inventor, designer, artist, writer, or engineer, and time off is one way to go about it. See the TED talk [the power of time off](http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off.html) by Stefan Sagmeister who closes his New York design for one year in eight to rejuvenate and refresh his creative outlook.
