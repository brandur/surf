While staying in Guiones, our guide Will told me an awesome story of his own entrepreneurship that I thought was worth sharing.

Faced with the bleak prospect of being completely broke, and wanting desperately to stay in Costa Rica, he used his Nikon SLR and 400 mm lens to take photos of surfers out on the waves (surfers are far enough out that 400 mm is about where you want to be to get nice closeups). He'd then track them down later and try to sell them a photo.

During this time, he was living out of a makeshift tent on the beach, and at night would keep his camera in the safe at a local hotel. If he wanted to eat for the day, he'd need to sell a picture, so incentive to sell was high.

I met a number of people who'd come down to Costa Rica from the first world (e.g. Canada, Italy, and Spain) and opened a restaurant, caf√©, or hotel. These industries would normally be setup for better profitability by catering to tourists rather than locals, and seemed to be doing well. The one major hurdle is finding something to do during the wet season where tourism dwindles to a trickle.
