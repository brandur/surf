_Note_: the full set of photos doesn't fit on the left, so please jump over to my [Guiones set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brandurleach/sets/72157625975582966/) to see the rest.

Our trip's second stop was a small town by the name of Playa Guiones (or simply Guiones), a rural place along the Pacific coast that was built solely around the large and consistent waves off the coast that make for ideal surfing. At any given time during dry season, a huge portion of the town's population are English-speaking surfers who are generally very friendly and make interesting conversationalists.

We stayed at a hotel called Kaya Sol, conveniently located right next to a restaurant (don't try to sit at its tables unless you're planning on eating there, it's run as an independent operation), and across the street from a small grocery store, a slightly more upscale hotel called the Gilded Iguana, and El Punto, a surf shop run by a great guy named Juan. All of these establishments are located outside of Guiones proper, which is about twenty minutes away on foot.

While not exactly rustic, Guiones still offered some of the best sightings of wildlife during my time in Costa Rica. One night we were walking back along the beach to Kaya Sol a little after sunset, and on a very lucky break, happened to stumble across a nest of baby turtles hatching and making their way down to the water. It was especially lucky that we recognized what they were, because in that light, a baby turtle looks remarkably similar to a beach rock.

For the first few days I expressed discontentment to my tour buddies over not yet having seen a howler monkey (this was supposed to be howler monkey central after all!). After getting back from surfing one day, we heard the trademark noise made by the howlers and Will suggested that I follow it back to its source, and I agreed. I put away my board, stepped back out of Kaya Sol, and looked up. To my surprise, an entire howler monkey troupe occupied the trees immediately above me, including nursing mothers.

One afternoon, Will took us along a beach route passed an abandoned hotel to a small beach side restaurant mainly frequently by locals called Olga's. The [casado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casado) (a standard plate of meat, rice, black beans, and salad) they made there was absolutely fabulous.

In our time at Guiones, we surfed and ate as much as we could, participated in no fewer than three beach fires, partied until being shut down by local security, and made some great friendships with other visitors to the area. Paradise.
