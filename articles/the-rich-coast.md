The other day when I mentioned that I was headed to Costa Rica, a coworker pointed out that Costa Rica means "Rich Coast". In hindsight, this is a perfectly sensible name for the country, and just something that I'd never thought about it before. This got me thinking: what else don't I know about this country? (Queue hit up Wikipedia)

Costa Rica's capital is a city of about 365,000 called San José and the country's total population is about 4.3 million. The official language of the country is Spanish, their currency is the Costa Rican colón (CRC), they drive on the right, are at UTC-6 (<abbr title="Central Time Zone">CTR</abbr>), and they have the top level domain `.cr` for nice web 2.0 naming (fli.cr?). As of 2009, their GDP was approximately $49 billion, of which tourism forms a larger part of than the combined exports of the country's three main cash crops: bananas, pineapples, and coffee.

Costa Rica is the only Latin American country included in the list of the world's 22 older democracies (countries that have been democratic since at least 1950). It's considered by the <abbr title="United Nations Development Programme">UNDP</abbr> to have obtained much higher human development than countries at similar levels of income. On the Environmental Performance Index, it ranked 3rd in the world (behind Switzerland in 2nd place, and another personal favorite, Iceland, leading the way in 1st).

History
-------

Costa Rica's indigenous population was small relative to nearby regions, and was largely wiped out from disease and mistreatment upon the arrival of the Spanish conquerors in the 16th century. The remainder were largely absorbed into colonial society, with the exception of a few tribes that inhabit to this day the Cordillera de Talamanca mountain range near the Panama border. One of those tribes called the Boruca still hold a three day festival annually re-enacting their resistance, and triumphant defeat, of the invading Spanish called the Danza de los Diablitos (the Dance of the Little Devils).

Climate
-------

Due to its proximity to the Equator, Costa Rica is tropical year round. Rather than the four seasons known elsewhere in the world, residents tend to split the year into just two periods, known as _Invierno_, winter, and _Verano_, summer. _Invierno_ is characterized by heavy rainfall and lasts from May to November, while _Verano_ represents the dry season and lasts from May to November.

Humidity tends to be higher on the Caribbean side than the on the Pacific side.

Economy
-------

Costa Rica economics stats are still a stark reminder that despite recent success, it's still a developing country. It faces the fourth highest inflation rate in Latin America (13.9% in 2008), lack of maintenance and new
 investment in infrastructure, a poverty rate estimated to be 5% to 8%, a 7.8% unemployment rate, and a trade 
deficit of 5.2%.

In 2006, the Costa Rican government allowed the CRC colón to float in an attempt to curb inflation and discour
age the use of US dollars. The plan was unsuccessful and the colón's value against the US dollar continues to
fall. Certain tax exemptions are offered by the central government for those companies willing to invest in the country. Several global high tech corporations including Intel have started developing in the area, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, as well as Procter & Gamble. In 2006, Intel's microprocessor facility alone was responsible for 20% of Costa Rican exports and 4.9% of its GDP. Ecotourism remains an extremely important cornerstone of the Costa Rican economy at $2.2 billion per year.

In recent years, Costa Rica's reputation as an eco-tourism destination has been somewhat tarnished when they turned a blind eye to the shark finning industry primarily selling to China and Taiwan.

Natural History
---------------

Costa Rica has a rich natural history. The country contains only 0.25% of the world's landmass, but 5% of the 
world's biodiversity. An impressive 25% of the country's land area is in protected national parks and areas.

Four species of monkeys are found in Costa Rica: the White-headed Capuchin, the Mantled Howler, Geoffrey's Spider Monkey, and the Central Amercan Squirrel Monkey. Around seven hundred species of birds have been identified. It's also home to the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana.
