A few days into my trip, I came to the abrupt realization that my sunscreen burn rate was far too great for the meager supply that I'd brought along to last. The obvious thing to do was to walk down to the local store and get some more, it was then that I first noticed what I've dubbed _the sunscreen conspiracy_.

In Costa Rica, both liquor and cigarettes are kept in stores out in the aisles with the standard issue grocery store products. This would generally be unimaginable in North America, but it's possible in Costa Rica because the price of these luxury items much more closely represents their actual cost. Rum was closer to $15 compared to more like $30 in Canada. I didn't buy any cigarettes, but was told they were just a few dollars a pack.

There was one luxury item though that's significantly pricier in Costa Rica: sunscreen. Even a no-name bottle is more expensive than a well-known brand in North America. Sunscreen can't be kept in the main aisles of the grocery store, instead it's stored in a locked case behind the counter.

I might be overreacting, sunscreen isn't _that_ cheap and it's possible the cost in Costa Rica is simply representative of the cost of getting it there. Occam's Razor seems to indicate that this is a more reasonable explanation than a country-wide conspiracy to profit by overcharging sunscreen-loving foreigners.
